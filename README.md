## About

This project is a result of a test that was assigned to me during my application to work at [Agenda Beleza](www.agendabeleza.com.br). It doesn't intend to be another solution of task management, although it's totally functional. My thought here was to open source it so other developers can check how to create single page apps with Ember.js + Rails API.

### Backend

- Build JSON RESTful APIs with Rails;
- Test APIs (models, controllers and serializers);
- Work with token authentication via HTTP headers;
- Allow Ajax Cross-origin requests on API via JSONP and CORS;
- Build DRYed controllers with proper action responses.

### Frontend

- Build a single page app with Ember.js;
- Organize your JS files according to the Ember's pattterns;
- Test your UI;
- Manage sessions through access token + Redis;
- Integrate Rail's models to your DS.Store;
- Use nested resources (routes and models);
- Work with Handlebars.
