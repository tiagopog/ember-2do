## About

This project is a result of a test that was assigned to me during my application to work at [Agenda Beleza](www.agendabeleza.com.br). It doesn't intend to be another solution of task management, although it's totally functional, my thought here was to make it a source so other developers can check how to:

### Backend

- Build JSON RESTful APIs with Rails;
- Test APIs (models, controllers and serializers);
- Work with token authentication via HTTP headers;
- Build DRYed controllers with proper action responses.

### Frontend

- Build a single page app with Ember.js;
- Organize your JS files according to the Ember's pattterns;
- Test your UI;
- Integrate Rail's models to your DS.Store;
- Work with Handlebars;
- Manage sessions through access token + Redis.
